### How to play
The 'leader' (purple triangle) will move between the player and enemy bases (blue square and red pentagon), bringing 'swarmers' (black dots) to attack the player base.  
By holding the left mouse button, you can damage swarmers around the cursor, causing them to become hollow rings, before being killed.  
Tab can be used to toggle displaying nodes and FPS.
